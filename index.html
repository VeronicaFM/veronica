                <p><em>The Left Point</em> is an attempt to make the audience realize the extent to which their understanding of news events can be manipulated. Through extreme censorship, the artist deliberately removes any possibility of accurate interpretation by suppressing the very opinions and discussions she set out to expose. How can you know that what you are watching is true, when most of it has been condensed to fit on your phone? This video-episode is the first of a series of works produced in post-referendum Belfast (Northern Ireland) to which media manipulation is being applied.</p>

                <p>Mich and Marshall are asked to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both participants come to experience a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally taken on by the other. This continuous one-shot 15-minute documentary performance demonstrates our empathetic capacity as individuals. This piece was made in response to recent scientific findings that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two individuals can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice.¹ <br> These findings inspired this performance for video in addition to bringing an empirical premise to the artist’s constant use of human interaction as a conceptual and political device.</p>

                <p>Veronica Mocker is a visual artist working and living in Montreal (QC) Canada. Her practice is about the experience and acknowledgment of other people. Through case-studies, videos, performances and interviews, Veronica’s work presents individuals and their realities to different types of audiences. She initiates real human interaction as a way to define, expose and induce progressive agency. She is driven by the simple idea that experiencing the other enables one’s consideration of the other, something she believes is needed more than ever. It is for this reason that her visual investigations are said to stand at the crossroads of conceptual art, documentary, new media and activism. Veronica was born in Quebec, Canada in 1991 and completed a BFA with Distinction at Concordia University in 2014. Since, her work has been featured locally and nationally in both solo and group exhibitions. She is represented non-exclusively by Canadian distributor <em>Videographe</em>. Veronica has conducted independent research both in Canada and abroad and has worked as a collaborator, curator, writer and cultural mediator in addition to receiving private and public funding for her endeavors.
