                <p>Mich and Marshall are asked to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both participants come to experience a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally taken on by the other. This continuous one-shot 15-minute documentary performance demonstrates our empathetic capacity as individuals. This piece was made in response to recent scientific findings that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two individuals can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice.¹ <br> These findings inspired this performance for video in addition to bringing an empirical premise to the artist’s constant use of human interaction as a conceptual and political device.</p>

The TEC (Theatre Engaging Communities) therefore serves to fund these projects, on condition that they are innovative in form or content and build ties with the community. This program combines the pursuit of artistic excellence with the determination to strengthen theatre’s social impact. | <a href="https://ent-nts.ca/en/tec/" target="_blank" >ent-nts.ca/en/tec</a></p>
