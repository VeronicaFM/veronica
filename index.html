These performances, which she imagines and produces with the students, are about their experiences, opinions and representation. Performed for the camera or for a live audience through the use of different documentary and performative conventions, the students week after week, conceptually reflect on the ways in which their self-documentation can occur, and the social importance of their depiction in a context such as Montreal; Québec; Canada. Praxes such as declaration, hommage, confidentiality, verbatim, speculation, manifesto, testimony are explored and embodied by the group. <em>Les Interprètes</em> is an experimental moment in which these teenagers are given back authorship and control of their own narrative and image. <br><br>This work is made in collaboration with the Centre Turbine <a href="http://centreturbine.org/projet/les-interpretes" target="_blank">centreturbine.org/les-interpretes</a>, thanks to the funding of <em>Fonds dédiés aux écoles publiques</em>, provided by the City of Montreal's Plateau-Mont-Royal arrondissement. <br><br>VIDEO TRAILER / IMAGES FROM THE PERFORMANCES<br>↓<br><br></p>

This work situates itself at the crossroads of performance art, documentary and installation. Presented in its staged environments are citizens and their important life narrative. The documentary performances of Rivières consist of two main elements : a soundtrack playing the testimony of a citizen, and the physical presence of this very citizen in front of an audience. Rivières’ first edition took place in Côte-des-Neiges’ community center and featured 8 individuals who live and work in this borough. <br>Information on Rivières' first edition, part of Montreal's 375th anniversary can be found at : <a href="http://rivieres375mtl.com/english.html" target="_blank">rivieres375mtl.com</a>.

In a similar way to its predecessor, this contemporary Québécois take on cinema vérité also presents a youth particular to its time, place and economic status. CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Veronica Mockler, 2016) documents the conversation of three white and young privileged individuals belonging to a typical Western world demographic. The issues raised by this somewhat captivating group of friends constitute the artist’s critique. The futility of their interaction, though entertaining at first, slowly becomes alarming for anyone viewing the work. How these young people have the luxury to be solely concerned with their hair colour is the reality the works aims to expose and subvert.<br><br>EXCERPT<br>↓<br><br></p>

Festival is on November 16-17-18, 2017.<br> <br> <em> This work borrows its title from famous French documentary classic CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Edouard Morin and Jean Rouch, 1961). In a similar way to its predecessor, this contemporary Québécois take on cinema vérité also presents a youth particular to its time, place and economic status. CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Veronica Mockler, 2016) documents the conversation of three young privileged white individuals belonging to a typical Western world demographic. The issues raised by this somewhat captivating group of friends constitute the artist’s critique. The futility of their interaction, though entertaining at first, slowly becomes alarming for anyone viewing the work. How these young people have the luxury to be solely concerned with their hair color is the reality the works aims to expose and subvert.</em> </p>

She graduated with distinction from Concordia University in Studio Arts (BFA 2014) after studying abroad in the Republic of Ireland to complete her degree. She is now returning 5 years later to Concordia University as a Master's candidate (MFA/MA-INDI) in Applied performance, Engaged Art & Public Pedagogy and Digital Oral History. Veronica is based in Montreal, where she lives and works as a social and relational artist. Her practice makes use of performance, video, documentary, social engagement, relational and conceptual art. The artist’s work has been featured in exhibitions and festivals in Canada, the US, South America and Europe. Mockler has been the recipient of public and private funding for her work with different individuals and communities as well as for her research abroad. In 2017 she co-founded the art collective Visible, who specializes in documentary social performance.<br><br>Statement<br><br> I work with individuals to present their reality and voice to audiences in order to socially challenge these given audiences. I hope to fill part of the gap that technology creates between real human interaction and virtual media connectedness. I am driven by the idea that the direct presence of someone is politically transformative and that one's existence and thoughts are worthy of art; of the art space; of the art world. I develop work in and out of the gallery by addressing social biases in the white cube and summoning sheltered folks into different communities. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the overthrow of rigid conservative ideals. By putting forth work that serves the agency of other individuals, I am also attempting to deconstruct my own privilege. <br><br>I am always looking for new collaborators. <br><br> #nonfictionmedia #performanceart #conceptualdocumentary #relationalart #artactivism #socialinteraction<br><br>© 2011-2019 Veronica Mockler</p>

Through extreme censorship, the artist deliberately removes any possibility of accurate interpretation by suppressing the very opinions and discussions she set out to expose. <br>This video-episode is the first of a series of works where entertainment, fake news and clickbait tactics are put to the test. The initial performances and footage of this first episode were produced in post Brexit-referendum Belfast, Northern Ireland in November 2016 in the midst of Donald Trumps final ascendancy to presidency. The artist asked 10 inviduals who identify as progressives to sit down and disagree with one another.</p>
