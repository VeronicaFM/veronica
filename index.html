These actions, which are imagined and produced around the students’ experiences and opinions, are often performed in front of a camera through the use of different documentary and performative conventions. Week after week, students are brought to conceptually reflect on ways in which self-documentation can occur, and the social importance and impact of such personal depiction. Frameworks such as hommage, confidentiality, verbatim, speculation, manifesto, testimony are explored and embodied by the group. <br><em>Les Interprètes</em> is an experimental moment in which these teenagers are given back authorship and control of their own narrative and image. <br><br>This work is made in collaboration with the Centre Turbine <a href="http://centreturbine.org/projet/les-interpretes" target="_blank">centreturbine.org/les-interpretes</a>, thanks to the funding of <em>Fonds dédiés aux écoles publiques</em>, provided by the City of Montreal's Plateau-Mont-Royal arrondissement. <br><br>IMAGES FROM THE PERFORMANCES / IN PROGRESS<br>↓<br><br></p>

This work situates itself at the crossroads of performance art, documentary and installation. Presented in its staged environments are citizens and their important life narrative. The documentary performances of Rivières consist of two main elements : a soundtrack playing the testimony of a citizen, and the physical presence of this very citizen in front of an audience. Rivières’ first edition took place in Côte-des-Neiges’ community center and featured 8 individuals who live and work in this borough. Rivières is a work that can be commissioned in any neighborhood, community, town or institution. <br>Information on Rivières' first edition, part of Montreal's 375th anniversary can be found at : <a href="http://rivieres375mtl.com/english.html" target="_blank">rivieres375mtl.com</a>.

Both participants come to experience a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally taken on by the other.

This piece was made in response to recent scientific findings that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two individuals can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice.¹ <br> These findings inspired this performance for video in addition to bringing an empirical premise to the artist’s constant use of human interaction as a conceptual and political device.<br><br>EXCERPT<br> ↓<br><br></p>

In a similar way to its predecessor, this contemporary Québécois take on cinema vérité also presents a youth particular to its time, place and economic status. CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Veronica Mockler, 2016) documents the conversation of three white and young privileged individuals belonging to a typical Western world demographic. The issues raised by this somewhat captivating group of friends constitute the artist’s critique. The futility of their interaction, though entertaining at first, slowly becomes alarming for anyone viewing the work. How these young people have the luxury to be solely concerned with their hair colour is the reality the works aims to expose and subvert.<br><br>EXCERPT<br>↓<br><br></p>

                        <p class=paragraphs>CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ // single channel | colour + sound | 09:58 minutes | 2016 <br>has been selected for GSTAADFILM 2018 Art Film Festival in Montevideo, Uruguay.<br>The work is being translated in Spanish! Festival is on November 16-17-18, 2017.<br> <br> <em> This work borrows its title from famous French documentary classic CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Edouard Morin and Jean Rouch, 1961). In a similar way to its predecessor, this contemporary Québécois take on cinema vérité also presents a youth particular to its time, place and economic status. CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Veronica Mockler, 2016) documents the conversation of three young privileged white individuals belonging to a typical Western world demographic. The issues raised by this somewhat captivating group of friends constitute the artist’s critique. The futility of their interaction, though entertaining at first, slowly becomes alarming for anyone viewing the work. How these young people have the luxury to be solely concerned with their hair color is the reality the works aims to expose and subvert.</em> </p>

			    <p> <br><br><br>Biography<br><br>Veronica Mockler (1991) was born in Québec, Canada’s French-speaking capital. She graduated from Concordia University in 2015 (Studio Arts/Intermedia) after living in the Republic of Ireland to complete her degree. Veronica has since been based in Montreal, where she lives and works as an interdisciplinary artist. Her work stands at the crossroads of conceptual art, documentary and social engagement. Mockler’s work has been distributed and featured in exhibitions and festivals, namely: WomenCinemakers (Berlin, Germany), Intersections 16th Biennial Arts and Technology (New London, CT, U.S.A.), Gstaad International Art Film Festival (Montevideo, Uruguay), Redding Flagg Gallery (Toronto, Canada), La Biennale Manif. d’Art Internationale (Québec, Canada), Cinéma sous les étoiles, Eastern Bloc, Vidéographe (Montreal, Canada). Veronica has worked as a facilitator (Leonard and Bina Ellen, Action Refugié Montréal) in addition to receiving private (Ann Duncan Award, CUSRA, and more) public (City of Montreal, MEESR Bursary, LOJIQ Grant, and more) funding for her endeavors in Montreal and abroad. <br><br>Short Statement<br><br>Basically, I think people are interesting and important —  I want them to be seen and heard.<br><br>Statement<br><br>Through video, performance and interview, I work with individuals to present their reality to audiences in order to socially challenge these given audiences. Through my projects, I hope to fill part of the gap that technology imposes between real human interaction and virtual media connectedness. I believe art is one of the rare remaining occasions in which human relatability can genuinely occur. This is why I use face-to-face performance, documentary testimony and the concept of hommage as tools to dismantle prejudice. I am driven by the idea that the direct presence of someone is politically transformative. I believe one's existence and opinions are worthy of art; are worthy of the art space; are worthy of the art world. I personally hold any art production socially accountable and thereby dedicate my practice to the overthrow of rigid conservative and capitalist ideals. By putting forth work that serves the agencies of other individuals and groups, I am attempting to deconstruct my own privilege. I develop projects in and out of the gallery space by inviting stigmatized agents into the white cube, and connoisseurs into the real world. I am always looking for new collaborators. <br> <br>ツ     hit me up    !<br><br>↓<br>

                		   <p>The work premiered on April 27, 2016 in Popspace Montreal in a solo exhibition of the artist’s work in collaboration with author Nick Williams. Accompanying exhibition literature : “The Mountains They Will Crumble”.</p>
                    		   <p>This work borrows its title from famous French documentary classic CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Edouard Morin and Jean Rouch, 1961). In a similar way to its predecessor, this contemporary Québécois take on cinema vérité also presents a youth particular to its time, place and economic status. CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Veronica Mockler, 2016) documents the conversation of three white and young privileged individuals belonging to a typical Western world demographic. The issues raised by this somewhat captivating group of friends constitute the artist’s critique. The futility of their interaction, though entertaining at first, slowly becomes alarming for anyone viewing the work. How these young people have the luxury to be solely concerned with their hair colour is the reality the works aims to expose and subvert.</p>
